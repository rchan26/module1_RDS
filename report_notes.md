The report that is in the email mainly seems like an analysis of the dataset
* Looks at the trend of happiness and mental health over time
* Looks at best predictors for happiness given their social status (employed, education, income level, etc)
* Mainly looking at correlations within the dataset. Opportunities to look at causal effects?
